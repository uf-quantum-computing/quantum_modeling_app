# Quantum Modeling App

Tunneling and Interference | Computational Nano Lab, UFL

> A Dynamic website design & architecture plan can be found in the _dynamic_website_arch.md_ file

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` inside the /src/ directory to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server

## File Structure

- `/model_generators/` - Contains the Julia scripts that generate the models.
- `/public/model_images/` - Contains the models generated by the Julia scripts. They are formatted as `<phenomenon_name>_<par1>x<par2>x<par3>.png` where `<par1>`, `<par2>`, and `<par3>` are the parameters of the model that can be changed by the user.
- `/src/` - Contains the source code for the React website.
  - `/src/App.tsx` - The main entry point for the website. This is where the React Router is set up to route to the different pages.
