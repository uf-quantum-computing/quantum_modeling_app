## Getting Started

### Prerequsites 
* Node ðŸ‘‰ install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
* Miniconda3 ðŸ‘‰ install [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/)

### Installation - Part 1

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uf-quantum-computing/quantum_modeling_app.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
    ``` 
    cd src
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the frontend development server
    ```
    npm start
    ```

### Installation - Part 2 

1. Create a conda enviornment for the project
    ```
    conda create --name my_env_name python=3.12
    ```
2. Activate conda enviornment
    ```
    conda activate my_env_name
    ``` 
    At this point you should see that conda is activated to the my_env_name and you should verify that the proper python version is being used. You can check this with the below command which should be python 3.12.
    ```
    python --version
    ```
3. Install dependencies 
    ```
    cd quantum_app_backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
4. Run backend 
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

### Running Locally 

1. Take the port that the backend is running on and replace it in these destinations.

For example I run the backend and I get this output "Running on http://127.0.0.1:3001"

I must navigate to the variable base_url in each file "Interference.tsx", "SingleQgate.tsx", and "Tunneling.tsx". Then replace the current value with the output of where your backend is running.

2. To run both the backend and the frontend, utilize 2 terminals in parallel.


## File Structure
- `/src/` - Contains the source code for the React website.
  - `/src/App.tsx` - The main entry point for the website. This is where the React Router is set up to route to the different pages.
  - `/src/pages` - Where each sub-page files are located
- `/backend_functions/` - Contains the backend code for handling requests and generating model gifs
  -  `/backend_functions/model_generators` - Contains the python code used to generate each model, ie `interference.py` or `tunneling.py`

## Tech Stack
### React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Sonar Cloud

Sonar Cloud is integrated with GitHub Actions to statically analyze code through the `.github/workflows/build.yml` and `sonar-project.properties` files.
