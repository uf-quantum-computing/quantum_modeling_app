# Dynamic Website Design & Architecture Plan

- Create a frontend with **React**

  - Use **React Router** enables "client side routing" and having multiple pages
  - Use **Material UI**, AntDesignfor state management
  - Use **Styled Components** for small, reusable components
  - Use **Redux** for state management and eliminate the need to use props or callbacks.

- Create API endpoints with **Node.js** & **Express**

  - The API endpoints will be used by the frontend to:
    1. run the respective julia script and generate data/images
    2. store the images in the database
    3. retrieve the images from the database

- Create a database with **MongoDB**

  - Used to store the images generated by the julia scripts
  - Organize by quantum phenomena (e.g. tunneling, wavefunction, spin, etc.)
  - Images will be named as such: `phenomena_name_par1xpar2xpar3.png`. For example, `tunneling_1x1x1.png` or `wavefunction_1x1x1.png`

    - The images can then be easily retrieved by the frontend by querying the database for the image with the name `phenomena_name_par1xpar2xpar3.png`

## Potential Challenges

- Storage management
  - Images are large files and will take up a lot of space
  - Need to find a way to store the images in the database without taking up too much space
    - Images should probably be deleted after a certain amount of time
- Runtime speeds
  - The julia scripts can take a long time to run
  - Need to find a way to:
    - Run the scripts on a server
    - Run the scripts in the background and not block the frontend
    - Run the scripts in parallel
    - Avoid running the a script if the image is already in the database
